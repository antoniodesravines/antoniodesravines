    <h3>Phillip O Berry Marching band</h3>
    <section><p1>I have been a part of the marching band since the summer before my freshmen year of highhool. I naturally had a love for drums, so I joined the dumline. At first, it was horrible. I wanted to quit because of the hard the work and physicalness it took. However, with time, and support from my band friends and fsmily, I pushed through and continue to get better at my craft day by day. I played the bass drum for my firt 3 years of high school, but for my final year I will have the honor of playing snare drum, arguably one of the hardest drums to master in he line.</p1></section>
    
    <h3>Code2College</h3>

Through Code2College, I have been able to expand my knowledge on the basics of python, as well as learn how to use basic circuits, draw circuit graphs, and learn about other electrical engineering devices such as potentiometers.</p1></section>
